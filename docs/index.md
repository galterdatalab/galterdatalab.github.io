## Welcome to the Galter DataLab

### Our Mission
We are focused on training & development, collaborative innovation, and connecting faculty, staff, and students in the Feinberg School of Medicine to data-related resources here at Northwestern. Through our free DataClinic service, we provide consultation and training for all stages of the research data life cycle. We engage the research community by hosting and sponsoring events that promote best practices related to reproducibility and openness in the sciences. We are developing a next-generation repository and data index system that will help scientists across the clinical and translational spectrum to locate tools, data, and expertise that will enhance their research process.

The DataLab is managed and supported by the [Galter HSL & Learning Center](https://galter.northwestern.edu/) in Northwestern University's [Feinberg School of Medicine](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/).
