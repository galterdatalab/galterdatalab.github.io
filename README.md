## Welcome to the Galter DataLab

### Our Mission
The DataLab is focused on collaborative innovation, training & development, and connecting faculty, staff, and students in the Feinberg School of Medicine to data-related resources here at Northwestern. Through our free [DataClinic](https://galter.northwestern.edu/about-us/datalab/#sectionTitle10022) service, we provide consultation and training for all stages of the research data life cycle and link researchers with experts who can help to resolve issues. We engage the research community by providing training and hosting and sponsoring events and workshops that support a range of technical topics and promote best practices related to data management, reproducibility, compliance with data sharing policies, and open science. Our services and projects reflect our commitment to good data practices and a collaborative culture at Feinberg and beyond.

The DataLab is managed and supported by the [Galter Health Sciences Library & Learning Center](https://galter.northwestern.edu/) in Northwestern University's [Feinberg School of Medicine](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/).
